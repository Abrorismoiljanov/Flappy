    #Hello there it is Flappy game basically flappy bird clone made in C and SDL2#
    ##############################################################################

This project is one of my first on learning C and SDL so I am sorry for my bad coding.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This was one of my earlier projects, and the code isn't perfect. 
For example, I used repeated variables instead of arrays in some places,
which I wouldn't do today. I'm keeping it here as-is to show my learning progress. üòä

I also made game to end if you loose for test and forgot about restart system so Sorry ü•≤

I used Linux for development by the way so IDK how it will work in other OS
